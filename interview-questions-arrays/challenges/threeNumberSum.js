Find a triplet that sum to a given value
Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array 
whose sum is equal to the given value. If there is such a triplet present in array, 
then print the triplet and return true. Else return false. For example, 
if the given array is {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9} and given sum is 24, 
then there is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) present in array whose sum is 24.

  hint 1: three loops to calculate the sums of all possible triplets

  hint 2: sort the array first and use two pointers techniques
  
  example for two pointers technique
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] target
